# TODO: Add Recipe Detail View

- [ ] Add `recipe_detail` view in `nutrition/views.py` to retrieve a specific recipe by ID and render a detail template.
- [ ] Add URL pattern in `nutrition/urls.py` for the detail view (e.g., `<int:recipe_id>/`).
- [ ] Create new template `nutrition/templates/nutrition/recipe_detail.html` to display full recipe information.
- [ ] Update `nutrition/templates/nutrition/recipes.html` to link the "View Details" button to the new detail page instead of opening a modal.
- [ ] Test the detail view by navigating from the recipes list.
- [ ] Verify all recipe information displays correctly on the detail page.
